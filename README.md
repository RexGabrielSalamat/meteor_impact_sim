# meteor_impact_sim
The Meteor Impact Simulation System models meteor impacts using Python, HTML, and JavaScript. It estimates destruction, affected areas, and casualties based on meteor data like size and speed. The project helps scientists and decision-makers assess risks, plan mitigation, and raise public awareness about meteor threats.
